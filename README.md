# GameOfLife

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life. With help from Laracast's (Code Katas)[http://laracasts.com/series/code-katas-in-php].

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/philsown/GameOfLife.git
$ cd GameOfLife
$ npm install
$ composer install
```

## Running Tests

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpspec run
```

## Automating Tests

With the help of Jeffrey Way's gulp file.

```bash
$ gulp
```

I like to run it silently so I only see the test output.

```bash
$ gulp --silent
```

Feedback invited. Send any to philsown at gmail. Thanks.
